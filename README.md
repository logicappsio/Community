## How to Submit ##

If you want to have your logic app showcased on our GitHub, submit a Pull Request with your project as a folder in this repository.  We will review the pull request and merge your code as quickly as we can.  Your submission could contain any or all of the following:
* API App Code for a Custom API App built for Logic Apps
* Azure Resource Template of an API or Logic App definition
* README with a link to another GitHub repo where code/sample lives (may be needed if you want to leverage the [Deploy To Azure](http://deploy.azure.com) functionality
